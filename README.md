Discord Bot of legend

# How to use
Make sure you have node and npm installed. Clone the repostiory and run "npm install" to get all the dependencies and stuff.

Add a file called config.json in the top level folder with the following format: 

``` json
{
	"prefix": "!",
	"token": "Token Here"
}
```

If you want the token, either text or email me. Replace the "Token here" with the actual token, making sure it's in quotes.

Simply open a command prompt and run the command "node bot.js" to get the bot online.
